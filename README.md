## First three.js project ðŸŽˆ

So far, it's different from just HTML and js files. Working with a whole bundler is very exciting.

### What I've learned:
- how to create a group & add them to the scene
- adding geometry into group
- what a axes helper is and why we use them
- changing cameras position
- the Clock method and `getElapsedTime()`
- creating animation with three.js
- three.js combined with gsap
